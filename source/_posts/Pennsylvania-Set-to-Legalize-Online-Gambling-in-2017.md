#  Pennsylvania Set to Legalize Online Gambling in 2017

Pennsylvania is set to legalize online gambling in 2017, making it the fourth state in the US to do so. The legalization of online gambling will allow the state to regulate and tax the industry, which is expected to bring in $200 million in revenue over the next five years.

Pennsylvania has been considering legalizing online gambling for several years, and finally passed a bill in October 2016. The bill allows casinos in the state to offer online poker, blackjack, roulette, and slots to residents of Pennsylvania. Players must be 21 or older and located within the borders of Pennsylvania to participate.

The legalization of online gambling is good news for Pennsylvania casinos, which have been struggling in recent years. The industry has been hit hard by competition from neighboring states, as well as by the economic recession. Online gambling will help casinos boost their revenues and keep up with their competitors.

The legalization of online gambling will also create new jobs in Pennsylvania. The industry is expected to employ 1,000 people by 2020, many of whom will be new graduates from casino management programs.

Online gambling is a growing industry worldwide, and Pennsylvaniaâ€™s decision to legalize it will benefit both consumers and businesses in the state.

#  Pennsylvania Online Gambling Bill Signed Into Law

On October 30th, 2018, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed the Pennsylvania online gambling bill into law. The new law regulates and legalizes various forms of online gambling within the state, including poker, casino games, and sports betting.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board will be responsible for issuing licenses and regulating the industry. Operators must be located within the state and will be subject to a 14% tax on gross gaming revenue.

The bill had strong bipartisan support in the legislature, with many lawmakers seeing it as a way to generate new revenue for the state. Revenue generated by online gambling will be used to fund property tax reductions, education initiatives, and infrastructure projects.

Opponents of the bill raised concerns about potential addiction issues and underage gambling, but these were largely dismissed by proponents who noted that similar concerns were raised when casinos were legalized in the state.

Pennsylvania is now the fourth US state to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. The market is expected to grow quickly as more states legalize it, with revenues reaching $4.2 billion by 2022 according to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC.

#  Pennsylvania Casinos Prepare for Launch of Online Gaming

_Pennsylvania casinos are preparing for the launch of online gaming, which is expected to take place in September. The move is expected to generate revenue for the state and create jobs._

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has approved 13 licenses for online gaming, which will allow casinos in the state to offer slots, table games, and poker. The first four licenses were awarded to Hollywood Casino York, Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino, and Mount Airy Casino.

"It is exciting that we are getting closer to launching on-line gaming," said Kevin O'Toole, chairman of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. "This new industry will create jobs and generate revenue for the Commonwealth."

Initially, only people who are physically located in Pennsylvania will be able to play at the state's casinos online. However, the board plans to eventually allow players from other states to participate as well.

#  Pennsylvania Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling

On October 25th, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill legalizing online gambling within the state. The bill had overwhelmingly passed the state legislature earlier in the month, with a vote of 109-72 in the House and a 27-13 vote in the Senate.

The passage of the bill makes Pennsylvania the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. Under the new law, Pennsylvanians will be able to gamble on casino games, poker, and other gambling activities through approved websites.

Governor Wolf said in a statement that he was glad to sign the bill into law and that it would provide "much-needed revenue" for the state. He also noted that the law would "protect consumers and ensure that our gaming industry is held to the highest standards."

Opponents of online gambling have raised concerns about addiction and money laundering, but supporters argue that such concerns are overblown. They say that online gambling can be regulated effectively and can provide a much-needed boost to local economies.

Pennsylvania's new online gambling law will go into effect on January 16th, 2018.

#  Pennsylvania GOP Leader Backs Legalized Online Gambling

The leader of the Pennsylvania Republican Party has come out in favor of legalizing online gambling, a move that could potentially bring in millions of dollars in new revenue for the state.

"I am in favor of it," said Pennsylvania GOP chairman Val DiGiorgio. "I think there's a lot of money to be made."

Pennsylvania is one of just a handful of states that have yet to legalize some form of online gambling. If DiGiorgio's support translates into action from the legislature, that could soon change.

Supporters of online gambling say it could provide a much-needed boost to the state's economy. The industry is currently worth an estimated $240 billion per year, and is growing at a rate of 10 percent each year.

Opponents argue that online gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for those who participate. But DiGiorgio dismissed those concerns, saying that people are already gambling away their money at casinos and racetracks.

"If they're doing it anyway, we might as well regulate it and tax it," he said.
