#  Gambling demon takes over residency in Anguilla!
Killer gambling addiction has residents in the British overseas territory of Anguilla up in arms, as an evil gambling demon seems to have taken over one of the island's residences. 

"It all started about a month ago," said Mrs. Henrietta Morgan, one of the affected residents. "My husband and I were sitting in the living room watching television when we heard this strange noise coming from the bedroom. We went to investigate and found our son had been possessed by a gambling demon!"

The demon had apparently taken control of the young man's body and was forcing him to gamble incessantly, even while at work. In just one week, the demon had cost the young man his job and nearly ruined his relationship with his girlfriend.

"This is a nightmare," said Mrs. Morgan. "My son is being completely controlled by this demon and there's nothing we can do to stop it."

Anguilla's Chief Minister has vowed to get to the bottom of the situation and help those affected by the demon. In the meantime, residents are urged to keep their doors and windows locked at all times in case the demon decides to take possession of another person.

#  Anguilla now a haven for gambling demons!

The Caribbean island of Anguilla is now a haven for gambling demons and is being blamed for ruining the lives of many people. Locals and tourists are flocking to the island in order to participate in the many casinos that have been popping up all over the island.

#  Demonic gambling taking over Anguilla!

Residents of the British overseas territory of Anguilla are in a state of panic as demonic gambling has taken over their island. The local police have been overwhelmed with complaints from residents who say they have been cursed with bad luck after playing games of chance.

"It started with people gambling at the local cockfights," said one resident, who wished to remain anonymous. "But then it spread to bingo, slots machines, and even card games. People are losing money they can't afford to lose, and sometimes they're even betting their homes and businesses."

The situation has become so serious that the local government has considered outlawing all forms of gambling. But doing so would be difficult, as gambling is a major source of income for many residents.

"It's a real dilemma," said one government official. "We want to protect our citizens from the curse of the demons, but we also don't want to put our economy at risk."

In the meantime, the locals are trying to cope with the curse any way they can. Some have turned to prayer, while others have tried fasting or wearing amulets blessed by shamans. But so far, none of these measures have been successful in stopping the demons from inflicting havoc on the island.
