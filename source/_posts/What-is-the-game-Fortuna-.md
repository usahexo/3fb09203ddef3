#  What is the game Fortuna? 

Fortuna is an online casino game that allows players to bet on virtual games of chance. The game can be played for free or for real money and offers a wide range of betting options.

# What are the benefits of playing Fortuna? 

There are a number of reasons why people might choose to play Fortuna. One of the main benefits is that it is a very social game, which can be enjoyed with friends or fellow players from around the world. There is also a great deal of excitement and suspense associated with playing, as players never know when they might hit the jackpot. Additionally, Fortuna offers players the chance to win some truly life-changing prizes and there is always something new to explore in the game.

# How do I get started playing Fortuna? 

To get started playing Fortuna, all you need is an internet connection and an account with an online casino that offers the game. Once you have registered for an account, you can load up the game and start betting on your favourite games of chance.

#  How do you play Fortuna? 

The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by taking risks and making smart bets. The player begins with 100 credits, which can be used to place bets on different outcomes. There are two sides to the game - the main board and the bonus board.

## The Main Board 

The main board is a 6x6 grid, with each space containing a different reward. To win, the player must fill up a row or column with the same symbol. The rewards vary from 3 to 10 credits, and there are also special symbols that can award extra points.

There are three ways to win on the main board - getting three of a kind, filling up a row or column, or getting one of the special symbols. When any of these things happen, the player is awarded the prize for that space and then moved on to the bonus board.

## The Bonus Board 

The bonus board is a 12x12 grid, with each space containing a different bonus. There are five types of bonus - free spins, extra credit, gamble, take risk, and wild card. Free spins are awarded when the player collects three of a kind on the bonus board, and give players an opportunity to earn more points without risking any additional credits. Extra credit awards players with an additional 25 credits, gamble allows players to bet their current score against a chance to earn more points, take risk awards either 5 or 10 credits depending on how risky the player wants to be, and wild card substitutes for any other symbol on the boards.
