#  Sports Betting Begins in CT on July 1st!

This Wednesday, July 1st, sports betting will officially become available in Connecticut! After the state legislature voted to legalize the practice earlier this year, sportsbooks at both Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino will open their doors and allow people to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.

The addition of sports betting is expected to not only bring more tourism dollars into the state, but also create new jobs in the casino industry. "This is a historic day for Connecticut as we usher in a new era of entertainment and opportunity," said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk) in a statement. "Legalized sports betting will create jobs, generate new economic activity and bring much-needed revenue to our state."

Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun are both finalizing their sportsbook operations and are expected to offer a wide range of bets, including on individual games, futures (e.g., who will win the Super Bowl), matchups, point spreads and over/unders. In order to place a bet, customers will need to be at least 21 years old and present valid identification.

While there is excitement around the launch of sports betting in Connecticut, there are also some legal uncertainties that still need to be addressed. For example, it's still not clear how the state will tax gambling winnings or what kind of regulations will be put in place governing how the sportsbooks operate.

In any case, starting Wednesday you'll be able to place bets on your favorite teams at either Foxwoods Resort Casino or Mohegan Sun!
