#  What is the difference between apparel and clothing?

The words "apparel" and "clothing" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings.

Apparel refers to items of clothing that are worn or intended to be worn on the upper part of the body. This includes items such as coats, jackets, shirts, blouses, and dresses. Clothing, on the other hand, refers to all types of garments, including both apparel and undergarments.

#  What is the purpose of clothing?

From the time our ancient ancestors first covered themselves in animal skins and leaves, clothing has been an essential part of human life. What is the purpose of clothing? Some people might say that it is simply to protect us from the elements, but there is much more to it than that.

Clothing can be used to express our personality, indicates our status within a society, or even shows our allegiance to a certain group. It can also make us feel more comfortable in certain situations by providing warmth or protection from the sun.

In some cultures, it is considered very important for women to dress in a certain way, while in others, men are the ones who are expected to dress a certain way. No matter what the culture, clothing plays an important role in how we are perceived by others.

Clothing can also be a form of self-expression. We might choose to wear something that makes us feel happy or confident, even if it isn’t considered to be “normal” attire for our gender or age group.

Overall, clothing performs many important functions and continues to play a significant role in human society.

#  Who decides what people wear?

One of the most, if not the most important, decisions a person will make is what to wear each day. The clothes we choose to put on our bodies can communicate many different messages, from seeking attention to trying to blend in. So who makes these decisions?

The answer to this question is complicated as there are many factors influencing what people choose to wear. Some people may be heavily influenced by advertisements or what their friends are wearing. Others may have a strong sense of personal style and be driven to dress in a unique way. And finally, some people may simply need help making decisions and will defer to others around them for guidance on what to wear.

There is no one right answer when it comes to who decides what people wear. It depends on the individual, their circumstances, and the culture they live in. However, it is clear that there are many different factors that play into what people put on their bodies each day.

#  How has clothing changed over time?

When we think about clothing, what usually comes to mind are items like shirts, pants, hats, and shoes. These are all pieces of clothing that have been around for a very long time. In fact, archaeologists have found evidence of these items being worn by people thousands of years ago.

Over time, there have been a lot of changes in the way that people dress. For example, consider the traditional outfit of a samurai warrior. This would include things like a kimono robe, hakama pants, and tabi socks. Today, samurai warriors no longer dress this way. Instead, they typically wear things like a t-shirt and jeans.

There are many different factors that have led to the changes in clothing over time. One major factor is technology. For example, the invention of the sewing machine made it possible to produce clothes in large quantities. This led to the development of mass-produced clothing items like t-shirts and jeans.

Another factor that has influenced clothing trends is culture. For example, in some cultures it is considered disrespectful to show too much skin. This has led to the development of clothing items like hijabs and burkas.

The way people dress also depends on the weather conditions. For example, in hot climates people often wear light and airy clothes like shorts and tank tops. In cold climates people tend to dress more warmly with items like jackets and boots.

Clothing plays an important role in society and it has changed a great deal over time

#  What affects fashion trends?

There are several factors that affect fashion trends. Some of these are cultural, societal, and economic factors. Other factors include technology, innovation, and the media. Let's take a closer look at each of these.

One of the most important factors that affects fashion trends is culture. Culture is the set of shared beliefs, values, customs, and traditions of a group of people. It can also be defined as the way of life of a particular group of people. When it comes to fashion, culture can dictate what is considered stylish or not. For example, in some cultures it is considered stylish to dress very conservatively, while in other cultures it is considered stylish to dress in a more provocative way.

Societal factors are also important when it comes to shaping fashion trends. Societal factors include things like technology, social media, and economic conditions. For example, the Industrial Revolution led to changes in how people dressed because new fabrics and technologies were developed. Similarly, the rise of social media has had a big impact on fashion trends. Today, social media allows people to share photos and videos of themselves wearing new styles instantaneously with friends and followers around the world. This has led to increased demand for certain types of clothing and accessories.

Economic conditions also play a role in shaping fashion trends. When times are tough economically, people may tend to dress more conservatively in order to save money. Conversely, when times are good economically people may be more likely to spend money on fashionable items.

Technology is another factor that affects fashion trends. For example, the invention of the sewing machine made it possible for clothes to be mass-produced which led to an increase in demand for clothing. And more recently, the development of smartphones and apps like Uber have led to the rise of "on-demand" fashion companies which offer personalized styling services and rent out designer clothes online.

Innovation also plays a role in shaping fashion trends. For example, over the years there have been several innovations in fabric technology such as Gore-Tex which has allowed for the development of waterproof clothing items. And more recently there has been a surge in the popularity of "athleisure" clothing which is clothing that can be worn both for athletic activities and for everyday wear. This trend can be attributed to innovations in fabric technologies that have made it possible to create clothing that is both comfortable and stylish at the same time.

The media is another factor that affects fashion trends. The media includes things like magazines, television shows, movies, and advertisements. Magazines often feature photographs of celebrities wearing the latest fashions; TV shows often feature runway shows where designers debut their latest collections; and movies often depict characters wearing specific styles of clothing or accessories.. The media can have a big influence on what people end up buying because they often see imagesof celebrities or fictional characters wearing certain items of clothing or accessories and they want to emulate those looks themselves
