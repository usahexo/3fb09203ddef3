#  Iowa Activities Betting Starts Today!

The Iowa Caucuses are finally here, and while the national focus may be on the Democratic and Republican nominees, there's still plenty of excitement to be had in the Hawkeye State. Today marks the beginning of legalized betting for political outcomes in Iowa, and there's already been plenty of action at the sportsbooks.

As always, Iowa is a critical state for both parties. For Republicans, it's a chance to prove that their current frontrunner is a viable candidate. For Democrats, it's an opportunity to see whether Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton has more grassroots support.

Bettors don't seem to think that either party is a lock, however. The Republicans are currently listed as a -125 favorite to win the Iowa Caucus, with Bernie Sanders coming in at +175 and Hillary Clinton at +325. The odds on Donald Trump winning have shifted since he announced his candidacy, but he's still considered a longshot at +750.

On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is currently favored at -145, with Hillary Clinton coming in at +115. These odds could shift further depending on how the next few weeks play out.

As always, the key will be getting out the vote on caucus night. This year's caucus should be especially interesting given the large field of candidates on both sides.

#  Iowa Fans Can Bet on Sports Now

Iowa residents can now place bets on sporting events through licensed online sportsbooks. In May, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission voted to legalize sports betting in the state, and since then, a few sportsbooks have launched operations.

Players in Iowa can now bet on professional and college sports, including baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer. Wagering is available both pre-match and in-play, and bets can be placed on a variety of outcomes, including the final result of a game, handicaps, over/unders, and more.

Licensed sportsbooks in Iowa offer players a variety of betting options. At FanDuel Sportsbook, for example, customers can bet on matchups for all major U.S. professional sports leagues, as well as select international leagues. Bets are also available for major college sports matchups from around the country.

At DraftKings Sportsbook, players can bet on NFL games starting Thursday night all the way through Super Bowl Sunday. In addition to straight bets on the outcome of a game, DraftKings offers proposition (prop) bets such as who will score first or what the exact margin of victory will be. Players can also bet on whether a touchdown will be scored in the first few minutes of a game or whether there will be a safety.

Most major U.S.-based online sportsbooks now offer betting on sporting events in Iowa. Some of the most popular sites include FanDuel Sportsbook, DraftKings Sportsbook, BetOnline Sportsbook, William Hill US Sportsbook, and 21Bet USA Sportsbook.

#  Get Ready for Some Action: Iowa Activities Betting is Open

Iowa is one of the states in the US that allows betting on different sporting events. Known as Iowa Activities Betting (IAB), this form of gambling is open to all residents of Iowa over the age of 21.

There are 11 casinos in Iowa that offer IAB, and each one offers a variety of betting options on different sports. The most popular sports to bet on are football, basketball, and baseball, but you can also bet on other things like auto racing, golf, and tennis.

If you're new to IAB, here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Know the odds - When you're betting on a sports event, it's important to know the odds so that you can make an educated decision about which bet to place. Odds are typically expressed as a fraction, with the numerator being the amount you stand to win and the denominator being the amount you have to wager. So, for example, if the odds for a particular event are 3/1, that means you would win $3 for every $1 you wager.

2. Place your bets early - Most casinos will allow you to place bets up until kickoff or start of the game in question. If you wait until later in the game to place your bet, you may not have as many options available to you.

3. Use parlays - Parlays are bets where you combine two or more bets into one single wager. This can increase your chances of winning but it also increases your risk if any of your bets lose.

4. research teams - Before betting on a team, be sure to do some research and find out how they've been performing recently. Sometimes there are good reasons why a team is favored or underdog and it's important to know what those reasons are before placing a bet.

5. know when to quit - It's important to know your limits when betting and when to walk away from the table if things aren't going your way. Gambling can be addictive and it's important not to let yourself get carried away with trying to win back money that you've lost.

Betting on sporting events can be a lot of fun and a great way to add excitement to watching games live or on television. By following these tips, you'll be able to increase your chances of winning while minimizing your risk losses

#  It's Officially Legal to Bet on Sports in Iowa: Time to Place Your Bets!

The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission has voted 3-0 to approve legalized sports betting in the state of Iowa. Governor Kim Reynolds is expected to sign the bill into law, making Iowa the ninth state in the US with legalized sports betting.

The legislation allows casinos in Iowa to offer betting on professional and collegiate sporting events, beginning as soon as September 1st. Bettors will be able to place bets both in-person and online, with the commission regulating licensing, rules, and taxes.

"This is good news for Iowa," said Reynolds in a statement after the vote. "The bipartisan support for this effort shows that Iowans believe that this is a common-sense reform that will create jobs, generate revenue, and keep our dollars in-state."

Casinos expect that sports betting will bring in an additional $9 million annually in tax revenue for the state. In addition, there are hopes that legalized sports betting will create new jobs in the casino industry.

"We are pleased that the Racing and Gaming Commission has taken this important step," said Jeff Lamberti, president of Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino. "We look forward to working with state officials to implement a program that benefits Iowans."

For those looking to place some bets on their favorite team, here's what you need to know about the new law:

* You must be 21 years or older to bet on sports in Iowa.

* Gambling addiction services will be available through the Department of Public Health.

* Betting on high school sporting events is not allowed.

* Casinos will be able to offer both pre-match and in-game betting.
