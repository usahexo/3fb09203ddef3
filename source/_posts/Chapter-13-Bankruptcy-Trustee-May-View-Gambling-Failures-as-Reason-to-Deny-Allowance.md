#  Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustee May View Gambling Failures as Reason to Deny Allowance

The role of the bankruptcy trustee is to administer the bankruptcy estate, review the debtor's filings, and liquidate the assets of the estate. The trustee may also oppose allowance of claims against the estate, including gambling losses.

In one case, the trustee asserted that a bankrupt's gambling losses should not be allowed as a deduction against income because they were incurred for personal reasons and not in connection with the bankruptcy estate. The court agreed, noting that allowing the deduction would amount to a windfall to the debtor.

The trustee may also oppose any claim for reimbursement of gambling losses made by a creditor. In one such case, a creditor sought to have its gambling losses reimbursed as an administrative expense. However, the court held that allowing such reimbursement would be contrary to public policy and would provide a windfall to the creditor.

#  Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustees Will Now Take Gambling Failures into Consideration

Bankruptcy trustees in the United States will now take gambling failures into consideration when determining a filer's eligibility for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, according to new guidelines released on Tuesday by the U.S. Trustee Program.

The change in policy comes as a response to the increasing number of people who are filing for bankruptcy due to gambling-related losses. Gambling-related bankruptcies have spiked in recent years, with more than 12,000 petitions filed in 2014, up from just 3,700 petitions in 2009.

"These changes reflect the reality that many Americans are struggling with serious financial problems as a result of their gambling," said Joyce Branda, acting general counsel for the Department of Justice. "The revised guidelines provide needed guidance to bankruptcy trustees on how they should account for these losses when evaluating a debtor's eligibility for bankruptcy relief."

Under the new guidelines, bankruptcy trustees will now be allowed to consider a filer's entire financial history when determining whether they are eligible for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This includes considering any losses suffered as a result of gambling activity.

The revised guidelines also make it easier for bankruptcy trustees to deny Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 relief to gamblers who have repeatedly failed to pay their debts. Previously, trustees were only allowed to consider a gambler's history of non-payment within the past year. Now, trustees can look back at the gambler's entire debt history in order to assess their likelihood of repayment.

The new guidelines were released just days after the Department of Justice announced that it was cracking down on illegal online gambling operations. The crackdown is part of a larger effort by the DOJ to combat all forms of illegal gambling.

#  How Does the Chapter 13 Trustee View Gambling Failures?

If you are considering filing for bankruptcy, it is important to be aware of the different types of bankruptcies and their consequences. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, also known as wage earner's bankruptcy, is a reorganization bankruptcy that allows people with regular income to propose a repayment plan to creditors.

One important factor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is the ability to make regular payments to creditors. If you cannot make your regular payments, your case may be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Gambling failures can often lead to debtors being unable to make their regular payments and can cause problems in a Chapter 13 case.

What Does the Chapter 13 Trustee Do?

The Chapter 13 trustee is responsible for ensuring that all payments are made according to the repayment plan. The trustee can also take actions to recover money from debtors who have failed to make their payments. This often includes taking money from debtors' paychecks or bank accounts.

The trustee may also file motions with the court seeking relief from the automatic stay in order to pursue litigation or foreclose on property. In some cases, the trustee may even seek dismissal of the case if debtors are not making their payments.

How Does Gambling Lead To Payment Failures?

Gambling can often lead to payment failures because it is an addiction that can be very difficult to overcome. Many people who gamble end up losing money that they can't afford to lose, resulting in missed payments and debt collectors calling them at all hours of the day and night.

In addition, gambling can often lead to financial distress, which can then lead to problems in other areas of life such as job loss or foreclosure. When financial distress becomes overwhelming, filing for bankruptcy may be the only option remaining for individuals and families.

Can I Continue My Gambling Habit If I File For Bankruptcy?

Gambling is not prohibited by law in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcies, but trustees have broad discretion over what actions they take against debtors who have failed to meet their payment obligations. In some cases, trustees may seek dismissal of a case or conversion to a chapter 7 bankruptcy if debtors are continuing their gambling habit despite not being able to make their regular payments.

It is important that you disclose all of your debts and expenses when you file for bankruptcy so that the trustee has a complete picture of your financial situation. If you omit information or lie on your paperwork, you could be subject to penalties including fines and imprisonment.

#  What Role Does the Chapter 13 Trustee Play in Gambling Failures?

If you're facing bankruptcy, whether due to gambling or any other reason, understanding the role of the chapter 13 trustee is important. This person will be responsible for administering your bankruptcy case, and will have a lot of say in how it proceeds.

The trustee's job is to ensure that all creditors are treated fairly and that all assets are properly liquidated to pay off as much debt as possible. In the case of gambling failures, this can mean selling off any assets that were used in the gambling activity.

The trustee may also require you to take certain actions as part of your bankruptcy case. For example, you may be required to attend budgeting or money management classes. You may also be required to stop using credit cards and to begin making payments toward your debts.

Failure to comply with the trustee's orders can result in penalties, including being forced to file for bankruptcy again or even having your case dismissed. So it's important to cooperate fully with the trustee and to follow their instructions closely.

#  Can a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustee Block Discharge for Gambling Failures?

When a person declares bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, they are asking the court to allow them a fresh start and reorganize their debts into a manageable payment plan. However, there are certain debts that cannot be discharged in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. One such debt is gambling losses.

Can a trustee in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy block the discharge of gambling losses? The answer is yes. Under 11 U.S.C. ยง1328, trustees can object to the discharge of any debt that they believe falls into one of the five prohibited categories:

1) Debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes
2) Debts not listed on the debtor's schedules
3) Defalcations by officers or directors of certain corporations
4) Domestic support obligations
5) Certain other kinds of debts
