#  Learn about poker hands in Yemen

In Yemen, poker is a popular card game. The aim of poker is to win the pot by assembling the best five-card hand possible. The rank of poker hands from lowest to highest is: high card, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, and royal flush.

In order to understand the ranking of poker hands in Yemen, it is important to know the rank of individual cards. The rank of an individual card is as follows: A (high), K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (low).

With that knowledge in hand let's take a look at some examples of ranked hands in Yemen. 

If you are dealt two different ranks (e.g. Ace and 2), the rank of the higher card determines the rank of the hand. So if you are dealt an Ace and a 2 for example your hand would rank as a high card. 

If you are dealt three different ranks (e.g. Ace-2-3), the rank of the highest card determines the rank of the hand. So if you are dealt an Ace-2-3 your hand would rank as a three of a kind. 

If you are dealt four different ranks (e.g. Ace-2-3-4), the rank of the highest card determines the rank of the hand. So if you are dealt an Ace-2-3-4 your hand would rank as a four of a kind. 

Now that we know how to read and interpret poker hands in Yemen according to their respective ranks we can take a look at some specific examples: 

A high card is any hand that does not contain any pairs or better. If you are dealt two different ranks (e.g Ace and 2), the rank of the higher card determines the rank of your high card hand - so an Ace and 2 would result in a high card ranking hand . If you are dealt three different ranks (e.g Ace-2-3), then your high card ranking hand would be three of a kind . Finally , if you are dealt four different ranks (e g . Ace - 2 - 3 - 4 ), your high card ranking hand would be four off a kind .

 
One pair consists of two cards with identical ranks . For example , if you were to draw two Kings from your five cards , then you would have made one pair with those Kings . If you were to draw an Ace and King , then you would also have made one pair with those two cards but because Kings beat Aces in Yemeni poker rankings , your one pair would be ranked higher than an Ace plus any other type combination .

 
Two pairs consists like its name suggests ,two different pairs . If for example you were to draw two Queens and two Jacks from your five cards , then congratulations – you’ve just won yourself TWO PAIRS ! As mentioned earlier in this guide , pairs always beat high cards so even if someone had drawn say an Ace as there strongest individual card they still wouldn’t win over someone with TWO PAIRS which contain two weaker Queen cards and two stronger Jack cards .

 
Three Of A Kind consist s o f three cards with identically ranks ei ther all threes or all twos or all ones etc .. So if for example somebody was playing with a deck that had only been punched out otally threes through sevens – then any player holding any combinationofthree threeswould automatically have won that particular round ! Because there are only seven different values possible and thirty two total Combinations when selecting three out these seven numbers – it makes it mathematically impossible for anyone else at the table to ever beat havingthreeofakindwiththosevalues .

Straight contains five consecutive cards but not all in succession from either end ei g ace through six OR 2 through 7 etc .. So for example drawing 5 , 6 , 7 8 , 9 results ina straigh t - since 5 is next highest number on list after 4 & 3 . NOTE : An ace can be used either as 1 or 11 whichever makes constructing straigh t easiest ; hence why straights containing ace are both called AKQJT & 102135 etc ..

Flush is composed o f five nonconsecutivecards BUT allthe same suit .. For example drawing clubs 7 , clubs 5 , hearts 10 clubs 4 & diamonds 2 results inherflushbecauseallofthecardsarestillsuitsclubs ..
