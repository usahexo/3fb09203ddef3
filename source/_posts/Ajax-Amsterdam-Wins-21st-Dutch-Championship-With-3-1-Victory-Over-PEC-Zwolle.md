#  Ajax Amsterdam Wins 21st Dutch Championship With 3-1 Victory Over PEC Zwolle

Ajax Amsterdam capped off an amazing season on Sunday, May 13th, 2018 by winning their 21st Dutch Championship with a 3-1 victory over PEC Zwolle. Ajax Amsterdam had already clinched the title last week when they defeated Heracles Almelo 6-0, but they wanted to win the championship in style and complete an undefeated season. The club has been on a roll in recent years, reaching the UEFA Europa League Final in 2017 and qualifying for this year’s UEFA Champions League.

PEC Zwolle started brightly and had a few chances in the first half, but it was Ajax who took the lead in the 36th minute when Lasse Schone scored from long range. The home side doubled their lead just before halftime when David Neres scored from close range. Zwolle pulled one back early in the second half through Darryl Lachman, but Donny van de Beek restored Ajax’s two-goal cushion in the 74th minute.

It was an impressive performance from Ajax Amsterdam, who were playing without key players such as Matthijs de Ligt (injured), Frenkie de Jong (absent due to international commitments) and Kasper Dolberg (left out of the squad). This latest championship win is a testament to the club’s remarkable youth development system, which has produced stars such as De Jong, De Ligt and Justin Kluivert.

Ajax Amsterdam will now turn their attention to the UEFA Champions League, where they will face Juventus in the first leg of their quarterfinal on April 10th.

#  Ajax Coach Frank De Boer Steps Down After Seven Years In Charge

 Ajax Amsterdam (known as Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax, AFC Ajax, or simply Ajax) is a Dutch professional football club based in Amsterdam. It was founded on 18 March 1900 by workers of the Amsterdam Electric Company. The club has enjoyed success throughout its history, with many championship titles and European trophies.

Frank de Boer has stepped down from his position as head coach of Ajax after seven years in charge, the club confirmed on Monday.Assistant coaches Dennis Bergkamp and Hennie Spijkerman will take over control of the first team until a new head coach is appointed.

"We have reached an agreement that Frank de Boer will step down as head coach of Ajax," technical director Marc Overmars said in a statement on the club's website. "We would like to thank Frank for his efforts and we wish him all the best for the future."

The decision follows Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Heracles Almelo which left Ajax languishing in 12th place in the Eredivisie table, six points off the relegation play-off places with 11 games remaining this season.

De Boer, who took over as head coach in 2010, led Ajax to four successive Eredivisie titles between 2011 and 2014 before he left to take charge of Serie A side Inter Milan but was sacked after just 85 days in charge. He returned to Ajax ahead of the 2016/17 season.
