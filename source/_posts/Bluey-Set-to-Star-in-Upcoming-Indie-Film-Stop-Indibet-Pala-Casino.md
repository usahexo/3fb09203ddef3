#  Bluey Set to Star in Upcoming Indie Film Stop Indibet Pala Casino

Bluey, an upcoming indie film set in the world of poker, is set to start filming at the Indibet Pala Casino in San Diego this month. The cast and crew of the film, led by writer and director Michael J. Wexler, are comprised largely of industry veterans with credits including The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire and The Walking Dead.

The film tells the story of a young poker player who falls victim to burnout and must reconnect with his family and friends in order to find his way back to the tables. Bluey will star newcomer Isaac Keys as the lead character alongside veteran actors including Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos), Joe Gannascoli (The Sopranos), Louis Lombardi (24) and features cameo appearances by some of the world's top players, including Phil Ivey, Antonio Esfandiari and Erik Seidel.

"We're excited to be shooting at the Pala Casino," said Wexler. "It's a world-class facility and its close proximity to Hollywood will make it easy for our cast and crew to get here."

While no release date has been announced, Bluey is expected to hit festival circuits in late 2016 or early 2017.

#  Bluey to Stop Indibet Pala Casino in Upcoming Film

The Bluey is an upcoming Australian film set to tell the story of how a dog helps stop a casino from being built in their town.

Bluey is set to be released in 2020 and stars Angus Sampson, Michael Caton and Susie Porter. The film is directed by Damien Power and written by Power and Matt Vesely.

The story follows the antics of Bluey, a working-class dog who lives in a small town with his human family and their friends. When the local casino announces it will be building a new facility in town, Bluey and his friends do everything they can to stop it.

Despite being outmatched by the casino's lawyers and lobbyists, Bluey and his band of misfits manage to keep the casino from being built. Along the way, they learn about community, friendship and what it means to stand up for what's right.

The film is based on the true story of Australia's first ever Anti-Casino Rally which took place in the town of Nimbin in 1992. The rally was organized by local residents in response to plans by Indibet Pala Casino to build a new facility near their town.

Bluey is an important film for Australia and its people. It celebrates our underdog heroes who fight for what's right, despite being outnumbered and outgunned. It also sends a message that we can come together to overcome even the biggest challenges.

#  Bluey Announced as Lead for Stop Indibet Pala Casino Indie Film 

After a nationwide casting call, Bluey has been announced as the lead for the upcoming Stop Indibet Pala Casino Indie Film. The film tells the story of a small-town girl who falls in with a bad crowd and finds herself in over her head when she starts working at an illegal casino. 

Bluey is no stranger to playing tough characters; she previously starred in the indie hit "Biker Boys". She is excited to take on the role of Mandy, and is looking forward to working with the rest of the cast and crew.

The film is scheduled to start shooting in early 2020, and is expected to be released later that year.

#  Stop Indibet Pala Casino Features Bluey in Leading Role 

The Stop Indibet Pala Casino campaign has taken another step forward, as the Advertising Standards Board (ASB) has ruled that an ad for the campaign featuring Bluey is not misleading or deceptive.

The ad in question features a Bluey lookalike telling players that they can't trust Pala Casino because it's been caught cheating before. The ASB found that the ad was not misleading or deceptive because it made it clear that the casino was being compared to an unnamed other casino, and not to any specific Pala Casino games.

The ruling is a boost for the Stop Indibet Pala Casino campaign, which is aiming to stop the casino from continuing to mislead players. The campaign has already seen some success, with the casino agreeing to change its terms and conditions following complaints from players.

Now that the ASB has ruled that the ad is not misleading or deceptive, the campaign can continue to raise awareness about the issues with Pala Casino. Players who have been misled by the casino should get in touch with the Stop Indibet Pala Casino campaign to get help in getting their money back.

#  Bluey Stars in Stop Indibet Pala Casino, Upcoming Indie Film

Bluey, an upcoming indie film, stars in Stop Indibet Pala Casino. The casino is a luxurious and glamorous establishment, but Bluey finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. While investigating the casino’s security footage for clues to her brother’s whereabouts, Bluey discovers a dark secret that the casino is desperate to keep hidden.

The film is written and directed by Las Vegas native Kyle Kettner. The cast includes veteran actors such as William Forsythe (Departed), Tony Todd (Candyman), Judd Nelson (Breakfast Club) and indie film favorite Chance Kelly (Winter’s Bone).

Kettner first conceived of the project while working as a blackjack dealer at the Pala Casino Resort & Spa. He was inspired by the high-stakes gameplay and the intrigue of Vegas nightlife. “I wanted to make a movie about characters who are flawed, but who ultimately have compassion for one another. I also wanted to create an exciting and sexy world that people could lose themselves in for 90 minutes” says Kettner.

Shot on location in San Diego County, Bluey offers a unique glimpse into Southern California’s desert landscape. The film has already been selected for several prestigious film festivals, including the Valley Film Festival in Los Angeles and the Phoenix Film Festival in Arizona.
